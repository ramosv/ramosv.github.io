                <h3>Colorado Weather Forecast</h3>
                <img src="images/ModelPicture.png">
                <p> • The current project is aimed at using historical weather data from the National Center for
                    Environmental Information to predict future temperature trends in the state of Colorado.<br>
                    • Analyzed past patterns and changes in temperature, the primary goal is to provide insights into
                    what
                    the future climate of Colorado may look like, particularly in the context of global warming and
                    environmental changes.<br>

                <h3>Mercuria Hackathon</h3>
                <img src="images/Mercuria.png">
                <p>• Participated in a collaborative weekend event, formulating innovative solutions for energy
                    transition
                    challenges related to the Texas Power Grid (ERCOT).<br>
                    • Analyzed data from multiple sources to craft a comprehensive multivariable statistical model.<br>
                    • Constructed and optimized a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) for accurate predictions of ERCOT
                    power
                    grid's future demand.<br>
                    • Developed potential solutions and delivered a presentation to support claims from our data.<br>
