            <h3>Colorado Weather Forecast</h3>
            <img src="images/ModelPicture.png" width="300" height="200">
            <p> • The current project is aimed at using historical weather data from the National Center for
                Environmental Information to predict future temperature trends in the state of Colorado.<br>
                • Analyzed past patterns and changes in temperature, the primary goal is to provide insights into what
                the future climate of Colorado may look like, particularly in the context of global warming and
                environmental changes.<br>

            <h3>Mercuria Hackathon</h3>
            <img src="images/Mercuria.png" width="300" height="200">
            <p>• Participated in a collaborative weekend event, formulating innovative solutions for energy transition
                challenges related to the Texas Power Grid (ERCOT).<br>
                • Analyzed data from multiple sources to craft a comprehensive multivariable statistical model.<br>
                • Constructed and optimized a Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR) for accurate predictions of ERCOT power
                grid's future demand.<br>
                • Developed potential solutions and delivered a presentation to support claims from our data.<br>
