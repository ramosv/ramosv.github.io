						<h2 class="major">Professional Summary</h2>
						<p>With a strong foundation in information systems, I am currently diving deeper into computer
							science through my master's studies, focusing on transitioning into a software engineering
							role. My experience spans from IT to hands-on software development, showcased by my
							participation in hackathons and personal projects. Fluent in both English and Spanish, I
							bring to the table effective communication skills, bridging technical nuances with clarity.
							My ability to translate technical details, combined with my growing software engineering
							expertise, positions me uniquely at the intersection of technology and practical solutions.

					<h2 class="major">Projects and hackathons</h2>
					<p>My recent experience at the Mercuria Hackathon, where I built a Vector Autoregressive Model to
						predict future demands on the Texas Power Grid, demonstrates my capability to participate
						effectively in data collection and analysis. During an intensive weekend of teamwork, I gained
						experience in building complex statistical models. These skills are a perfect match for the
						research
						duties that require developing and improving research methods and working with data.
					</p>
					<p>Participating in the Mile High Hackathon in Denver, CO, earlier in the year allowed me to embrace
						the power of technology in serving the community. In this case, we focused on non-profit and
						civic
						organizations, and I collaborated with two team members to develop a Sentiment Analysis using
						Lexicon-Based Models. Our goal was to organize thousands of files for the nonprofit
						organization,
						The Fax Denver. This experience demonstrated my commitment to making a positive impact in the
						community and reinforced my software engineering skills, which are crucial for working on
						application and development of software tools.</p>
					<p>As a masterâ€™s Student in Computer science with a 3.7 GPA, I am familiar with the theoretical and
						practical aspects of programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java. My academic and
						personal
						projects often involve these languages along with additional tools such as Pandas and Matplotlib
						for
						analyzing and interpreting data.</p>
					<p>I am enthusiastic about any opportunity to bring my strong motivation and my dedication to
						academic
						excellence, as evidenced by my current GPA which reflects my commitment to my studies. While I
						understand that intership positions are competitive, I am eager to discuss how my
						background, skills, and enthusiasm make me a strong candidate for the role being offered.
